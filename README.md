An Informatics Engineering student from Indonesia passionate about solving real-world problems through Machine Learning, Web Development, and purpose-driven technology.

I enjoy building intelligent systems and user-focused web applications, especially those that address real-world challenges. I believe technology should empower communities ‚Äî whether through machine learning models for public good, responsive websites for social engagement, or decision-support tools that make services more accessible.

> I see technology not just as code, but as a conversation between people and problems ‚Äî a continuous journey of learning, building, and improving to create meaningful solutions.

Right now, my main focus is on Artificial Intelligence ‚Äî exploring how intelligent systems can be designed not only to solve technical problems but also to create meaningful impact for communities.
